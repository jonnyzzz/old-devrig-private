# The PROJECT merges with MCP Steroid project, see https://mcp-steroid.jonnyzzz.com.

Make your AI Agent change code with fewer cleanup loops.

MCP Steroid gives your AI Agent the same semantic actions a JetBrains IDE gives humans — typed refactors, inspections, debugger, test runs — so the Agent finishes in fewer attempts and you spend less time verifying its output. Ships today as a JetBrains IDE plugin.


# Older version:

The command to start the AI-empowered development environment of your project.
With all possible IDEs, extensions, and configurations.
With local development, Docker, and remote development.
Including IntelliJ, Cursor, VSCode, and any other IDEs.

## Goal

Create the world's most popular universal tool to start a pre-configured, fine-tailored development environment for humans and agents.
We make new developers and agents ready for coding after only one command: `./idew start`.

## What is devrig?

IDE Wrapper is a universal command-line tool that automatically downloads, configures, and launches pre-configured development environments for your projects.
One command (`./idew start`) gets any developer or AI agent ready to code with the exact IDE setup their project needs.

**Problem it solves:** No more "it works on my machine" issues. No manual IDE installation, extension hunting, or configuration copying. Perfect for:
- Onboarding new developers in minutes
- AI coding agents needing consistent environments  
- Open-source projects with complex setup requirements
- Teams wanting standardized development environments
- Easy transition to remote development or docker environments

## Project Status

⚠️ **Alpha/Proof of Concept** - This project is in early development. Everything can change.

The tool looks for the `.idew.yaml` file for configuration. 

The IDE is downloaded and configured under the `.idew` directory next to the `.idew.yaml` file. 

The file is of the following format, which allows specifying the IDE that is used to open the project, e.g. 

```yaml
wrapper:
    version: 0.0.1
    hash: sha-512:<hash>

ide:
    name: GoLand        #IDE which is needed
    version: 2024.3     #public version
    hash: sha-512:<hash>
    #build: optional build number
    #more ide-spefic parameters 
```

The tool is compatible with [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) to provide configurations.

## Install Command

The `devrig install` command allows you to install fonts and development tools that are commonly used in development environments.

### Installing JetBrains Mono Font

JetBrains Mono is a free and open-source typeface designed for developers. To install it on your system:

```bash
devrig install jetbrains-mono
```

This command will:
- Download the latest version of JetBrains Mono from the official GitHub repository
- Extract and install the font files to the appropriate system directory:
  - **Windows**: `%WINDIR%\Fonts`
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Fonts`
  - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/fonts/JetBrainsMono`

The installer works on all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and architectures (x86_64, ARM64).

**Security:**
- SHA-512 checksum validation ensures download integrity
- Checksums are maintained in the devrig codebase as the source of truth
- Downloads are verified against known-good checksums from official GitHub releases
- All downloads occur over HTTPS from: https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono

# AI Coding Agents to support next

Here is an expanded and structured list of AI coding agents you can install and run locally. The ranking is approximate, based on recent community popularity, GitHub stars, expert reviews, and widespread use. "Can support offline mode" means the agent can function fully on your hardware, without sending code or prompts to third-party servers.

Perfect! Here's the complete merged list of **31 AI coding agents** with all information consolidated:

| Name               | Agent URL                                        | Rank | Offline Mode Support |
